# Style-transfer
Style Transfer is a technique in computer vision and graphics that involves generating a new image by combining the content of one image with the style of another image. The goal of style transfer is to create an image that preserves the content of the original image while applying the visual style of another image.
I used Gatys teqnique to solve this problem. You can read about this article here: https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf
